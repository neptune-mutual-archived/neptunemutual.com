        Blockchain-based covers typically have a low claims-to-payout ratio.
        Existing cover products are unscalable, discretionary, and
        discriminatory. Smart contract audits do not guarantee security. Attacks

        This new feature enables a diversified cover pool creator to create a

        parameters and cover policies; users can buy cover policies from these
        individual projects. Because liquidity from the diversified cover pool
        is underwriting multiple different projects with diversified risk, the
        diversified cover creator can choose to leverage the underwriting
        liquidity to provide more than 1 DAI of cover for 1 DAI of liquidity.
        Diversified Cover Pools therefore cannot provide the absolute guarantee
        of payout to policyholders in the way that Dedicated Cover Pools can,
